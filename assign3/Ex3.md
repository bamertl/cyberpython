### Exercise3

It depends. so the generator is known. Then for one part:
A = ga = g + g + g + g.

this means that a is simply A / g.

If the group would be cyclic too, it would be differnt, it would howeber still not be required to solve a log problem.
You could however still calculate a from A = ga by calculating the modular inverse $g^{-1} \mod n$
In the exercise it was however called an additive group and not a cyclic additive group.
